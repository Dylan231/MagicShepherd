// fire repeated events
//aTimer.AutoReset = true;// Not necessarry here probably.

// Start timer at the start of the script and end when sheppard or dog has been detected.
Also start timer at end of script after the PSO sheep have moved to their position.

then do this for all sheep and then set a waiting period. 
// When one wants to wait then use yield return 0; in order to wait a certain amount of
frames.
